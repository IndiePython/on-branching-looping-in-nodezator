# Implementing Branching and Looping in Nodezator

This project consists of an article on implementing branching and looping in the Nodezator app.

This article was created to communicate the planned approach to implementing branching and looping in Nodezator to users. The discussion regarding this work can be found on [this link](https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator/discussions/34). There you can share your feedback on this article, suggest improvements, etc.

You can see the table of contents below. You probably should read the article from beginning to end, rather than jump between specific parts.
